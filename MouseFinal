 * THIS PROGRAM WAS CREATED BY NOAH HUPPERT
 * DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CLAIM THIS PROGRAM AS YOUR OWN
 * IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION CONTACT ME UNDER NOAH_h ON THE LEAP DEVELOPER FORMS
 * THIS PROGRAM IS MEANT TO EMULATE A BASIC MOUSE DRIVER FOR THE LEAP MOTION
 * THE CLICKING IS A LITTLE HARD TO GET USED TO
 * POINT WERE YOU WANT THE MOUSE TO GO
 * TO CLICK TRY AND KEEP POINTING AT WHAT YOU WANT TO CLICK ON AND JAB BUT DON'T JAB TO HARD
 * I MADE THIS PROGRAM SO THAT US DEVELOPERS COULD PLAY AROUND FOR A LITTLE
 *
